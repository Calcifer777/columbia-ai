\subsection{Heuristics}

\paragraph{Admissible heuristic} An admissible heuristic never
overestimates the cost to reach the goal, that is it is
optimistic. A heuristic h is admissible if:
\begin{math}
  \forall\medspace node \medspace n, \medspace h(n) \leq h^*(n)
\end{math}
where $h^*$ is true cost to reach the goal from $n$.

In a map, the air distance between two points is an admissible
heuristic because it is by definition the shortest distance
between the two points.

    get from $n$ to the goal ($h$)
  }

\subsection{A*}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Complete
  \item Time: exponential
  \item Space: keeps every node in memory
  \item Optimal: If the heuristic function used by A* is
    admissible, then A* is admissible. 
    An intuitive proof of this is as follows: When
    A* terminates its search, it has found a path from start to
    goal whose actual cost is lower than the estimated cost of
    any path from start to goal through any open node (the node's
    $f$ value). 
    When the heuristic is admissible, those estimates are
    optimistic (not quiteâ€”see the next paragraph), so $A*$ can
    safely ignore those nodes because they cannot possibly lead
    to a cheaper solution than the one it already has. 
    In other words, A* will never overlook the
    possibility of a lower-cost path from start to goal and so it
    will continue to search until no such possibilities exist.
    (The actual proof is a bit more involved because the
    $f$ values of open nodes are not guaranteed to
    be optimistic even if the heuristic is admissible. This is
    because the $g$ values of open nodes are not guaranteed to be
    optimal, so the sum $g+h$ is not guaranteed to be optimistic)
